This is a app with NodeJS. Here I use MongoDB as Database system and Node Js as backend.
The functionality is simple: Simulate a real blog.

You can use the code in the way you want.

*How to test te app:
  1- Need to open MongoDB to store date and use it previously.
  2- If you donwload this file, open the terminal in this file, then open the terminal and type "$ node app.js"
  3- now you need to go at the web browser, and type "localhost:2000" because there is the app loaded.


  notes:
    You PC must have "LAMP" or "WAMP" to run this, because is the necesary for you pc to be a local web server.
